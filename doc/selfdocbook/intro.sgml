   The Selfdocbook itself
  </title>

  <para>
   The &sdb; is a self-documenting introduction to DocBook DocBook
   book.  It includes its own DocBook SGML source in the <link
   linkend="source">appendix</link>, and so can be used to learn
   DocBook by example.

   You can get a copy of the &sdb; in various ways; presumably you
   already know one of them since you are reading the &sdb; right now.
   Here are the choices:

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     View it using a web browser, by pointing it to the <ulink
     url="http://people.redhat.com/twaugh/docbook/selfdocbook/selfdocbook.html"><literal>selfdocbook</literal>
     &sdb; web page</ulink>.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Grab the <ulink
     url="http://people.redhat.com/twaugh/docbook/selfdocbook.ps">PostScript
     version</ulink>, ready to print out.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Fetch the <ulink
     url="http://people.redhat.com/twaugh/docbook/selfdocbook.tar.gz">DocBook
     SGML source</ulink> and build it.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   You can use the &sdb; to learn DocBook by example: if you see
   something that you want to know how to do, you can simply flip to
   <xref linkend="source"> to find out how it is done.
  </para>

  <para>
   I learned DocBook from the excellent book <citetitle>DocBook:
   The Definitive Guide</citetitle> by O'Reilly Associates,
   also <ulink url="http://docbook.org/tdg/html/docbook.html">available
   online</ulink>.  It is probably a good idea to have a glance
   through that in order to get more of an overview than this book
   provides.

   This &sdb; was built on &builddate;.
